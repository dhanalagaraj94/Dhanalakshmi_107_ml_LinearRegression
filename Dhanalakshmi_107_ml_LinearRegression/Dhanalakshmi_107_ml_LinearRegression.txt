Project Title: Synthetic Healthcare Dataset Analysis and Prediction
1. Project Overview:
This project analyzes a synthetic healthcare dataset to predict treatment costs using machine learning models.
It includes data preprocessing, model building, and visualization to understand relationships between features such as age, BMI, gender, and treatment cost.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Objective:
Handle missing data and preprocess features.
Use machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict treatment costs.
Apply KMeans clustering to group patients based on similar features.
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (Treatment Cost).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes the following features:

Age: Patient's age.
BMI: Body Mass Index of the patient.
Gender: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
Smoker: Whether the patient is a smoker (Yes/No).
Region: Region of the patient.
Chronic Disease: Whether the patient has a chronic disease.
Treatment Cost: The target variable to predict.

4. Methodology

4.1 Data Preprocessing:
Missing Data: Missing values were filled with the most frequent value (mode) for categorical features.
Encoding: Categorical features (Gender, Smoker, Region, Chronic Disease) were converted into numeric values using LabelEncoder.
Normalization: Numerical features (Age, BMI, Treatment Cost) were standardized using StandardScaler.

4.2 Supervised Learning:
Linear Regression: A linear regression model was trained to predict treatment costs.
Random Forest Regressor: A random forest model was also trained and evaluated.

4.3 Unsupervised Learning:
PCA: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data for easier visualization.
KMeans Clustering: KMeans clustering was applied to group patients into 3 clusters based on their features.

4.4 Data Visualization:
Visualizations were generated to show relationships between features such as Age, BMI, and Treatment Cost.
A correlation heatmap was used to display how features are related to each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Output:

Missing Values:
There were no missing values in the dataset after preprocessing.

RMSE for Models:
Linear Regression: RMSE = 0.403
Random Forest: RMSE = 0.441
These values show that Linear Regression performed better than Random Forest in predicting treatment costs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Visualizations:

KMeans Clustering: A scatter plot showing how patients are grouped into clusters based on their features.

Age vs Treatment Cost: A scatter plot to see how age affects treatment costs.

BMI vs Treatment Cost: A scatter plot to see how BMI relates to treatment costs.

Feature Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap displaying the correlations between different features.

Treatment Cost Distribution: A histogram to show the distribution of treatment costs.

Gender Distribution: A bar chart to show the gender distribution in the dataset.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Findings and Insights:

Model Performance: The Linear Regression model had a lower RMSE, making it a better choice for this dataset.

Cluster Analysis: KMeans successfully identified three distinct patient groups.

Feature Importance: Age and BMI have a positive correlation with higher treatment costs.

Treatment Cost Distribution: The distribution of treatment costs was slightly skewed, with lower treatment costs being more frequent.

8. Conclusion:
The project effectively predicted treatment costs using machine learning models. 
Linear Regression provided better accuracy compared to Random Forest. 
The KMeans clustering helped identify distinct patient groups, and visualizations provided valuable insights into the relationships between features.
